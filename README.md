### Experimental Routing System with Rust and Tauri

### Project Idea
Welcome to my project! I started this journey with the goal of expanding my knowledge and gaining a deeper understanding of Rust and Tauri. While I may not have all the answers yet, I'm excited to share my vision for a simple routing system through this project. Below, you'll find a diagram that represents my initial thoughts and ideas.
